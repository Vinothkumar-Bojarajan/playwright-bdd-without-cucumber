# Project Setup and Configuration Guide for Playwright BDD with Cucumber

This guide outlines the process of setting up and configuring a testing project using Playwright with a custom BDD approach. It includes detailed instructions, code examples, and explanations to help you understand each step and its advantages.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**  
  Ensure Node.js is installed from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). Node.js enables JavaScript execution outside the browser environment.

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
  Download and install VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is a versatile code editor with extensive extension support to boost productivity.

## Key Considerations for the Custom BDD Approach

- **Feature and Step Separation**  
  In this approach, feature is written as test case with steps, and each step is implemented as a function within the same test case.

- **Logging for Debugging**  
  To facilitate debugging, each step logs its execution at the beginning of the function. This ensures that test reports and standard output provide clear insights into the progress of the test, including which steps have passed and where failures occurred.

- **Playwright Integration**  
  Instead of relying on the Playwright test runner or external BDD packages, this approach leverages the existing Playwright framework to simulate a BDD-style workflow. This method provides flexibility while maintaining compatibility with Playwright's core features.

By following this approach, you can effectively implement BDD-style testing while utilizing the robust capabilities of the Playwright framework.
